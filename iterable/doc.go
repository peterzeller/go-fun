/*
Package iterable provides an interface Iterable for types that can be iterated over.

The interface has a single method that returns an Iterator.

This package contains many functional methods that can be used to transform or create Iterable instances.
This makes Iterable a good datastructure to work with lazy streams of data, similar to IEnumerable in C#.
